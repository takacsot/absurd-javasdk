# Changelog

This contains the changes between releases.

# Unreleased

* Removed the SQL dependency on `uuid-ossp`; UUIDv7 generation continues to use PostgreSQL's native UUIDv7 function when available and otherwise builds UUIDv7 values using PostgreSQL's built-in random UUID generator.

# 0.4.0

* Added a Go SDK.  #80
* Added partitioned queue storage support.  #83
* Changed workers in the Go, Python, and TypeScript SDKs to defer claimed unknown tasks back into the queue instead of immediately failing runs.
* Fixed terminal run-state race handling across SQL and SDKs so cancellation/failure transitions are treated as terminal consistently.
* Fixed the Python SDK's synchronous worker to honor configured `concurrency` and run tasks in parallel when `concurrency > 1`.
* Fixed Python SDK registered tasks without per-task retry config to fall back to the client default max attempts.
* Improved Python SDK type annotations and hook handling for better static type-checking and async hook interoperability.
* Fixed Go SDK spawn behavior to require an explicit queue when spawning unregistered tasks.
* Fixed `absurdctl spawn-task` to pass headers, max attempts, retry strategy, and cancellation policy inside the SQL `spawn_task` options payload.
* Improved Habitat's retry flow to navigate to newly spawned retry tasks.

# 0.3.0

* Added task-result inspection and waiting APIs across SQL and SDKs, including `absurd.get_task_result()`, `app.fetchTaskResult()` / `app.awaitTaskResult()` in TypeScript, `fetch_task_result()` / `await_task_result()` in Python, and durable child-task waits from task contexts.
* Added decomposed step support to the TypeScript and Python SDKs with `beginStep()` / `completeStep()` and `begin_step()` / `complete_step()`.
* Added `absurdctl install-skill` and bundled the Absurd agent skill into absurdctl releases.
* Added absurdctl PyPI packaging and publishing, including `uvx`-friendly builds in CI.
* Added range-based SQL export to `absurdctl migrate --dump-sql`, making it possible to generate a bundled migration script for an explicit `--from` / `--to` version range without connecting to Postgres.
* Fixed SDK task-result waiting to reject invalid timeout values, prevent infinite polling on `NaN`, and fail fast when a task tries to wait on another task in the same queue.
* Aligned default database resolution order across `absurdctl`, the TypeScript SDK, and the Python SDK.

# 0.2.0

* Added `absurd.retry_task()` stored procedure for retrying permanently failed tasks, either in-place or by spawning a new task from original inputs.  #75
* Added version-aware migration support to `absurdctl`.
* Set up PyPI publishing for the Python SDK as `absurd-sdk`.
* Added documentation site.
* Added date range selector to tasks and events pages in Habitat.
* Added auto-refresh toggle to the events page in Habitat.
* Standardized timestamp rendering and tooltips across Habitat.
* Fixed reactive loop in Habitat causing excessive polling (~1 req/s) on the tasks page.
* Fixed Habitat to use stable asset filenames without content hashes for consistent load-balanced deployments.
* Fixed timestamp display alignment to UTC and GMT offsets in Habitat.

# 0.1.1

* Added `AB002` error code for already-failed runs in `set_task_checkpoint_state` and `extend_claim`, letting SDKs gracefully handle stale execution.
* Replaced task name text filter with a combobox that caches recent task names in Habitat.
* Added inline filter icons for task name, queue, and status columns in Habitat.
* Allow multiple task rows to stay expanded simultaneously in Habitat.

# 0.1.0

* Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities in `absurdctl`.  #68
* Added `emit-event` command to `absurdctl` for publishing queue events from the CLI.  #67
* Fixed TypeScript SDK lease handling to reschedule timers after `heartbeat` and checkpoint writes.
* Fixed Habitat task listing to avoid partial results when database queries time out.
* Added a collapse/expand-all toggle for task payload panels in Habitat.  #71
* Enforced first-write-wins semantics for `emit_event`, so later emits no longer overwrite cached event payloads.
* Improved `absurd.claim_task` to bound cancellation and expired-lease sweep work per claim call.
* Hardened `absurd.extend_claim` to validate input and reject missing, non-running, cancelled, or unclaimed runs.
* Improved checkpoint reads: `get_task_checkpoint_state` now hides pending rows by default, and `get_task_checkpoint_states` is run/attempt-aware.
* Added queue-name byte-length validation and aligned queue-name validation behavior across SQL and clients.
* Added queue indexes for run `claim_expires_at`, wait `task_id`, and event `emitted_at` to improve claim and cleanup performance.
* Prevented deadlocks by aligning lock acquisition order across `cancel_task`, `complete_run`, and `fail_run` paths.

# 0.0.8

* Fixed Habitat sub-path deployment support and hardened prefix handling for UI/API routes.

# 0.0.7

* Improved Habitat UI timeout handling and added auto-refresh.  #56

# 0.0.5

* Added `bindToConnection` method to TypeScript SDK.  #37
* Added support for SSL database connections.  #41
* Fixed `absurdctl spawn-task` command.  #24
* Changed Absurd constructor to accept a config object.  #23
* Fixed small temporary resource leak in TypeScript SDK related to waiting.  #23
* Added support for connection strings in `absurdctl`.  #19
* Changed TypeScript SDK dependencies: made `pg` a peer dependency and moved `typescript` to dev dependencies.  #20
* Added `heartbeat` to extend a claim between checkpoints.  #39
* Added explicit task cancellations.  #40
* Ensure that timeouts on events do not re-trigger the event awaiting.  #45
* Add tests to TypeScript SDK and make `complete`/`fail` internal.  #25
